# valtio-zod 

Validate your [valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio) store values with [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

## What is this

[valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio) is
a proxy state library for ReactJS and VanillaJS.

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a TypeScript-first 
schema validation library with static type inference.

valtio-zod is an attempt to make validating your store values
with zod as easy as possible.

## Project Status

Planning and early development. We are still trying to iron out details on how best to implement this
as these two libraries work in very different (you might even say opposing) ways. All ideas and feedback
are welcome and strongly encouraged.

## How to use it

You can't...yet. It is still in development. Check out the issues tab for discussions if you'd like to
learn more.

## What are all those files?

This project used [valtio-yjs](https://github.com/valtiojs/valtio-yjs) as a template starting point.
